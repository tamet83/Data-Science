    "So far, you've used lambda functions to write short, simple functions as well as to redefine functions with simple functionality. The best use case for lambda functions, however, are for when you want these simple functionalities to be anonymously embedded within larger expressions. What that means is that the functionality is not stored in the environment, unlike a function defined with `def`. To understand this idea better, you will use a lambda function in the context of the `map()` function.\n",

    "\n",
    "result = map(lambda a: a ** 2, nums)\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see here that `a` lambda function, which raises a value a to the power of 2, is passed to `map()` alongside a list of numbers, `nums`. The map object that results from the call to `map()` is stored in `result`. You will now practice the use of lambda functions with `map()`. For this exercise, you will map the functionality of the `add_bangs()` function you defined in previous exercises over a list of strings."
